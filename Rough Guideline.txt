Hypothesis
Presenting the data to allow individuals to come to their own conclusions whether or not global warming is a real thing. 
We must be sure to present data that support both claims and stories on how you can portray the data. 
(possibly explore the idea of how data manipulation and how you portray the data can skew the story to a side when manipulated properly)
